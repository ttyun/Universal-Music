# Universal-Music

As a passionate fan of music, it can be very tiring to have to switch between playlists because not all
music is necessarily on Apple Music and vice versa. As a result, I decided to create an application
that would serve to be a platform that is compatible with both.

Universal Music is an iOS application that combines Spotify and Apple Music into a single platform.
The application is written in Swift and Objective-C.
Note: Spotify and Apple Music Premium accounts are needed for full access.
Further Note: SoundCloud integration is still pending.
